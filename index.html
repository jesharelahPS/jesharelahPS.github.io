                    <br><b>Verse</b><br>
                    Paper bags and plastic hearts<br>
                    All our belongings in shopping carts<br>
                    It's goodbye<br>
                    But we got one more night<br>
                    <br>Let's get drunk and ride around<br>
                    And make peace with an empty town<br>
                    We can make it right<br>
                    <br><b>Chorus</b><br>
                    Throw it away, forget yesterday<br>
                    We'll make the great escape<br>
                    And we won't hear a word they say<br>
                    They don't know us anyway<br>
                    Watch it burn, let it die<br>
                    'Cause we are finally free tonight<br>
                    <br><b>Verse</b><br>
                    Tonight will change our lives<br>
                    It's so good to be by your side<br>
                    We'll cry<br>
                    We won't give up the fight<br>
                    <br>We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs<br>
                    And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young<br>
                    And we'll feel so alive<br>
                    <br><b>Chorus</b><br>
                    Throw it away, forget yesterday<br>
                    We'll make the great escape<br>
                    And we won't hear a word they say<br>
                    They don't know us anyway<br>
                    Watch it burn, let it die<br>
                    'Cause we are finally free tonight<br>
                    <br><b>Bridge</b><br>
                    All of the wasted time<br>
                    The hours that were left behind<br>
                    The answers that we'll never find<br>
                    They don't mean a thing tonight<br>
                    <br><b>Chorus</b><br>
                    Throw it away, forget yesterday<br>
                    We'll make the great escape<br>
                    We won't hear a word they say<br>
                    They don't know us anyway<br>
                    <br>Throw it away, forget yesterday<br>
                    We'll make the great escape<br>
                    And we won't hear a word they say<br>
                    They don't know us anyway<br>
                    <br>Throw it away, forget yesterday<br>
                    We'll make the great escape<br>
                    And we won't hear a word they say<br>
                    They don't know us anyway<br>
                    Watch it burn, let it die<br>
                    'Cause we are finally free tonight<br>
